title: About
---

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at Miami Herbert Business School supervised by [Prof. Lan Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/lanwang/home).
Before that, I earned my Master in **Statistics** from University of California, SanDiego and earned my Bachelor's degree in **Applied Math** in University of Science and Technology of China.

Research Interests
======

My research interests spans various fields, including statistics, operations management, and reinforcement learning. I am particularly interested in leveraging the unique structure of data—such as censored data, high-dimensional sparse data, and missing data—in real-world applications. Currently, I focus on privacy-concerned data-driven operations and Statistical Reinforcement Learning with high dimensional settings.
